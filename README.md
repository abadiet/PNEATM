# Large Recurent Neural Network (RNN) powered by NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
C++ library for evolving neural networks with a modified NEAT that is able to access any previous data, allowing any kind of data

# TODO
- [ ] NEAT
- [ ] generic kind of obj (float, vectors...)
- [ ] use of multiple kind over one network
- [ ] allow multiple activation function
- [ ] allow recurent connection from any level
- [ ] memory arg on activation functions
- [ ] normalisation?
